    """
    Compute the mean Hilbert projective loss between pairs of vectors.

    NB: Usually the Hilbert projective loss takes the logarithm of U and V
    first, but since the output of the predictive network is already in the log
    domain, we omit this step.

    Parameters
    ----------
    U : (n_samples, dim) torch.Tensor
        First set of vectors.
    V : (n_samples, dim) torch.Tensor
        Second set of vectors.

    Returns

    loss : float
        Mean loss value.
