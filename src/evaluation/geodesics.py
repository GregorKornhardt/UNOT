    """
    Computes the McCann interpolation at time t using bilinear mass distribution.

        This function calculates the displacement interpolation between two probability measures
        using optimal transport, where the mass is distributed bilinearly to avoid visual artifacts.
        The interpolation is performed on a regular grid in [0,1]^2.

        Parameters
        ----------
        P : ndarray
            (N*N, N*N) array representing the optimal transport plan between source and target measures
        grid_points : ndarray
            (N*N, 2) array containing the coordinates of grid points in [0,1]^2
        t : float
            Interpolation time parameter in [0,1]. t=0 gives source measure, t=1 gives target measure
        N : int
            Grid size (resulting interpolation will be on NxN grid)

        Returns
        -------
        ndarray
            (N, N) array representing the interpolated measure Î¼_t at time t

        Notes
        -----
        The bilinear distribution helps avoid visual artifacts by spreading mass across
        neighboring grid points based on the precise position of the interpolated points.
        For each mass transfer from point i to j, the interpolated mass is distributed
        to up to 4 neighboring grid points using bilinear weights.
